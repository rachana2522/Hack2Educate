THEME 1 :- A BETTER SEARCH ENGINE FOR EDUCATION

Users can ask any educational question or choose any micro-topic they want to learn and \
they will be shown the best related educational content categorised by platform: \
Twitter threads, Quora answers, brainly answers, wikipedia articles, reddit posts, third-party websites, etc. 

Users can contribute more resources, upvote good resources, downvote bad resources 

Build a distraction-free zone for students to learn from the best educational content from around the Internet.



How will you solve the problem?

Searching and accessing information for a relevant topic is difficult as there are many resources and finding the best resource is time-consuming. So to overcome this, our idea is to build a website/app to look for information about topics that are relevant to their interests. Collection of learning resources organized by topics, videos, and articles, and based on ratings the user can search through audio or search bar or through scan to help them to find the best resource. These allow students to target specific information and access journal articles and educational resources.
Our goal is to build a website which will allow any user to search their query which will in turn will show answers to their questions in the form of videos. We will do this by using APIs of the resulting videos via subtitles, comments and/or matching relevant description to check and identify the correct solution to the question from a certain timestamp of the video.

What will be your final demo?

Our final demo will include a full hands on working prototype which we will showcase available resources for everyone to access easily. We want to build a web application that let's anyone from anywhere can search anything they want. based on the user inputs the website gives results based on top rating and it includes only relevant information about that topic.

for example: if we search like "Apple" the google will show about the Apple inc and also about the apple fruit which is irrelevant. so our website provides only educational related information to the users through audio search/scan/text. Our hope is to give our model the light of the day.
